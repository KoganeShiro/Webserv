## Rules
**Summary**:
    No crashing: The server must not crash, even if it runs out of memory.
    Makefile: Required for building the project.
    Library Restrictions: External and Boost libraries are forbidden.
    Allowed Functions: Use only specified C++98 functions and system calls.
    Executable: Write an HTTP server in C++98, executable with `./webserv [configuration file (or default path)]`.
    Pre-requisites: Read the RFC, test with telnet and NGINX.
**Constraints**:
     Do not execve another web server.
     Must be non-blocking; use only one poll() (or equivalent) for all I/O operations.
	 Must not read/write without poll().
     Must check read and write simultaneously with poll().
     No checking errno after read/write operations.
     Must be compatible with a web browser.
     Accurate HTTP response status codes.
     Default error pages if none are provided.
     Use fork only for CGI.
     Serve static websites.
     Support GET, POST, DELETE methods.
     Handle file uploads.
     Stress test to ensure availability.
     Listen on multiple ports (configured via file).

**Configuration File**:
    Define port and host for each server.
    Optionally set server names.
    Set default server for host:port.
    Default error pages and client body size limits.
**Route configuration**:
     Accepted HTTP methods.
     HTTP redirection.
     Directory/file roots.
     Directory listing toggle.
     Default file for directories.
     Execute CGI based on file extension.
     Handle POST and GET for CGI.
     Accept file uploads and configure save location.

## What is a Web Server
### Definition
A web server is a computer system or software that hosts websites and delivers web pages to users over the internet or an intranet. It handles incoming requests from clients (such as browsers) and serves them the requested web pages.

### Why is a web server important?
Web servers are essential because they make it possible to access websites and web applications. Without web servers, the internet as we know it would not function, as there would be no way to deliver web content to users.

### How does a web server work?
A web server works by accepting requests from clients (typically web browsers) and responding with the appropriate web pages or resources. When you type a URL into your browser, the browser sends a request to the web server, which processes the request and sends back the requested HTML page, images, or other files.

### In Summary
A web server is a critical component of the internet, responsible for delivering web content to users. It is essential for anyone involved in web development or IT to understand how web servers operate to create and manage web-based services.

### Other Notes
Web servers can be software (like Apache, Nginx, or IIS) or dedicated hardware. They can serve static content (like HTML files) or dynamic content (generated by web applications).

## HTTP
### Definition
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and information between servers and browsers.

### How does HTTP work?
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client (browser) and a server. When you enter a URL in your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server, which then processes the request and sends back the requested web page or resource in an HTTP response.

### In Summary
HTTP is a vital protocol that facilitates communication and data exchange on the web, making it possible for users to access and interact with web content.

### Other Notes
- HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent and does not retain information about previous interactions.
- HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, which encrypts data to protect it during transmission.

## Quick Start
To get started quickly, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:KoganeShiro/Webserv.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Webserv/webserv`
3. Install make if you haven't
4. Run the application: `make`

## Usage
To use this project
You can `make` and execute the execuable `./webServ config_file/default.config`

You may need to change the config file so it will be ok to use the servername, the address + the port
